\section{Experimental Results}

\acp{BN} are flexible, they can be used for different purposes

%\subsection{Object Shape Estimation}

%estimate object shape, based on inferred action (gesture) and resulting effect. $p(O \mid A, E)$

\subsection{Effect Prediction}

$p(E \mid A, F)$

\subsection{Prediction of Words}

We compare the \ac{BN} predictive power in terms of word nodes, with and without the Action prior information provided by the Gesture \acp{HMM}.

$p(W \mid A, E, F)$

$p(W \mid E, F)$
