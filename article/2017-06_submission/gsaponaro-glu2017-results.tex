\section{Experimental Results}

We present two types of results: prediction over the effects of actions, and prediction over the word descriptions. In the latter case, we compare the words obtained by the \acl{BN} in the presence of an action prior, with the ones obtained in the absence of the action information.

\subsection{Effect Prediction}

We predict the values of effect-related nodes~(Object Velocity and relative Object--Hand Velocity), given the action node~(provided by the hard decision of Gesture \acp{HMM} when classifying SHOW FIG) and nodes related to object features~(Shape and Size).

TODO expand:
\begin{verbatim}
  p(ObjVel, ObjHandVel | A=tap, F=circle small)

  =

      0.0478    0.0000    0.0000
      0.2921    0.1266    0.0098
      0.0001    0.0903    0.4332
\end{verbatim}
\ie medium or fast motion.

\begin{verbatim}
  p(ObjVel, ObjHandVel | A=tap, F=box big)

  =

      0.9984    0.0002    0.0002
      0.0005    0.0002    0.0000
      0.0000    0.0001    0.0003
\end{verbatim}
\ie slow or no motion.

\subsection{Prediction of Words}

We compare the \ac{BN} predictive power in terms of word nodes, with and without the Action prior information provided by the Gesture \acp{HMM}. In other words, we compare~$p(W \mid A, E, F)$ with~$p(W \mid E, F)$.

TODO work in progress, looking for a combination of E,F which makes the result significant
